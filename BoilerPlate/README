This is a blank extension template. It doesn't really do anything on its own.
It is intended to provide a boiler template for an actual MediaWiki extension.

If you are checking this out from Git and intend to use it, you may use the
following commands to make a clean directory of just this template without the
Git meta-data and other examples.

	git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/p/mediawiki/extensions/examples.git mw-extensions-example-repo
	cp -R mw-extensions-example-repo/BoilerPlate ./MyExtension

This automates the recommended code checkers for PHP and JavaScript code in Wikimedia projects
(see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Continuous_integration/Test_entry_points).
To take advantage of this automation.
  # install nodejs, npm, and PHP composer
  # change to the extension's directory
  # npm install
  # composer install

Once set up, running `npm test` and `composer test` will run automated code checks.
