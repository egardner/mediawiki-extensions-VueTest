/**
 * Class XmlContent represents XML content.
 *
 * This is based on TextContent, and represents XML as a string.
 *
 * Using a text based content model is the simplest option, since it
 * allows the use of the standard editor and diff code, and does not require
 * serialization/unserialization.
 *
 * However, text based content is "dumb". It means that your code can't make use
 * of the XML structure, making it a bit pointless. If you want to use and manipulate
 * the XML structure, then it should be represented as a DOM inside the XmlContent.
 *
 * In that case, XmlContentHandler::serializeContent()
 * and XmlContentHandler::unserializeContent() would have to be used for
 * serializing resp. parsing the XML DOM.
 *
 * Also, a special editor might be needed to interact with the structure.
